Aims:
Design and evaluate recommendation systems tailored for an online learning platform to enhance user experience through personalised course recommendations.
Use methodologies and algorithms to improve user engagement and satisfaction on educational platforms.

Key Findings:
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into user-item interactions and dataset characteristics.
Implemented Content-Based Recommender Systems to match user profiles with course genres for personalised recommendations.
Used Collaborative Filtering Algorithms to recommend courses based on similar user preferences and interactions.
Evaluated algorithm performance using metrics such as RMSE, precision, and recall to optimise recommendation accuracy.

Impact:
Enhanced online learning experiences by providing personalised course recommendations, benefiting educators, platform developers, and data scientists.
Improved user satisfaction and engagement on online learning platforms by delivering relevant and tailored content.

Future Directions:
Explore advanced techniques such as deep learning for more accurate predictions and handling complex user-item interactions.
Incorporate real-time feedback mechanisms to continuously refine and improve recommendation quality.
